  abstract = {Work on synthetic biology has largely used a component-based metaphor for system construction. While this paradigm has been successful for the construction of numerous systems, the incorporation of contextual design issues-either compositional, host or environmental-will be key to realising more complex applications. Here, we present a design framework that radically steps away from a purely parts-based paradigm by using aspect-oriented software engineering concepts. We believe that the notion of concerns is a powerful and biologically credible way of thinking about system synthesis. By adopting this approach, we can separate core concerns, which represent modular aims of the design, from cross-cutting concerns, which represent system-wide attributes. The explicit handling of cross-cutting concerns allows for contextual information to enter the design process in a modular way. As a proof-of-principle, we implemented the aspect-oriented approach in the Python tool, SynBioWeaver, which enables the combination, or weaving, of core and cross-cutting concerns. The power and flexibility of this framework is demonstrated through a number of examples covering the inclusion of part context, combining circuit designs in a context dependent manner, and the generation of rule, logic and reaction models from synthetic circuit designs.},

Tellurium is a modular, cross-platform, and open-source simulation environment composed of multiple libraries, plugins, and specialized modules and methods. Tellurium is a self-contained modeling platform which comes with a fully configured Python distribution. Two interfaces are provided, one based on the Spyder IDE which has an accessible user interface akin to MATLAB and a second based on the Jupyter Notebook, which is a format that contains live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Tellurium uses libRoadRunner as the default SBML simulation engine which supports deterministic simulations, stochastic simulations, and steady-state analyses. Tellurium also includes Antimony, a human-readable model definition language which can be converted to and from SBML. Other standard Python scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib are included by default. Additionally, we include several user-friendly plugins and advanced modules for a wide-variety of applications, ranging from complex algorithms for bifurcation analysis to multidimensional parameter scanning. By combining multiple libraries, plugins, and modules into a single package, Tellurium provides a unified but extensible solution for biological modeling and analysis for both novices and experts.Availabilitytellurium.analogmachine.org.},

  abstract = {Modeling biochemical systems can provide insights into behaviors that are difficult to observe or understand. It requires software, programming, and understanding of the system to build a model and study it. Softwares exist for systems biology modeling, but most support only certain types of modeling tasks. Desirable features including ease in preparing input, symbolic or analytical computation, parameter estimation, graphical user interface, and systems biology markup language (SBML) support are not seen concurrently in one software package. In this study, we developed a python-based software that supports these features, with both deterministic and stochastic propagations. The software can be used by graphical user interface, command line, or as a python import. We also developed a semi-programmable and intuitively easy topology input method for the biochemical reactions. We tested the software with semantic and stochastic SBML test cases. Tests on symbolic solution and parameter estimation were also included. The software we developed is reliable, well performing, convenient to use, and compliant with most of the SBML tests. So far it is the only systems biology software that supports symbolic, deterministic, and stochastic modeling in one package that also features parameter estimation and SBML support. This work offers a comprehensive set of tools and allows for better availability and accessibility for studying kinetics and dynamics in biochemical systems.},

Various approaches have been used to model the steady state behavior of metabolic networks using genome-scale reconstructions, but formulating dynamic models from such reconstructions continues to be a key challenge. Here, we present the Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation Python (MASSpy) package, an open-source computational framework for dynamic modeling of metabolism. MASSpy utilizes mass action kinetics and detailed chemical mechanisms to build dynamic models of complex biological processes. MASSpy adds dynamic modeling tools to the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Python (COBRApy) package to provide an unified framework for constraint-based and kinetic modeling of metabolic networks. MASSpy supports high-performance dynamic simulation through its implementation of libRoadRunner: the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) simulation engine. Three examples are provided to demonstrate how to use MASSpy: (1) a validation of the MASSpy modeling tool through dynamic simulation of detailed mechanisms of enzyme regulation; (2) a feature demonstration using a workflow for generating ensemble of kinetic models using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate missing numerical values of parameters and to quantify biological uncertainty, and (3) a case study in which MASSpy is utilized to overcome issues that arise when integrating experimental data with the computation of functional states of detailed biological mechanisms. MASSpy represents a powerful tool to address challenges that arise in dynamic modeling of metabolic networks, both at small and large scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract             With the rise of Systems Biology as a new paradigm for understanding biological processes, the development of quantitative models is no longer restricted to a small circle of theoreticians. The dramatic increase in the number of these models precipitates the need to exchange and reuse both existing and newly created models. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a free, open, XML-based format for representing quantitative models of biological interest that advocates the consistent specification of such models and thus facilitates both software development and model exchange.Principally oriented towards describing systems of biochemical reactions, such as cell signalling pathways, metabolic networks and gene regulation etc., SBML can also be used to encode any kinetic model. SBML offers mechanisms to describe biological components by means of compartments and reacting species, as well as their dynamic behaviour, using reactions, events and arbitrary mathematical rules. SBML also offers all the housekeeping structures needed to ensure an unambiguous understanding of quantitative descriptions.This is Release 1 of the specification for SBML Level 2 Version 4, describing the structures of the language and the rules used to build a valid model.

  abstract = {Background and objectivesBiological systems with intertwined feedback loops pose a challenge to mathematical modeling efforts. Moreover, rare events, such as mutation and extinction, complicate system dynamics. Stochastic simulation algorithms are useful in generating time-evolution trajectories for these systems because they can adequately capture the influence of random fluctuations and quantify rare events. We present a simple and flexible package, BioSimulator.jl, for implementing the Gillespie algorithm, {$\tau$}-leaping, and related stochastic simulation algorithms. The objective of this work is to provide scientists across domains with fast, user-friendly simulation tools.MethodsWe used the high-performance programming language Julia because of its emphasis on scientific computing. Our software package implements a suite of stochastic simulation algorithms based on Markov chain theory. We provide the ability to (a) diagram Petri Nets describing interactions, (b) plot average trajectories and attached standard deviations of each participating species over time, and (c) generate frequency distributions of each species at a specified time.ResultsBioSimulator.jl's interface allows users to build models programmatically within Julia. A model is then passed to the simulate routine to generate simulation data. The built-in tools allow one to visualize results and compute summary statistics. Our examples highlight the broad applicability of our software to systems of varying complexity from ecology, systems biology, chemistry, and genetics.ConclusionThe user-friendly nature of BioSimulator.jl encourages the use of stochastic simulation, minimizes tedious programming efforts, and reduces errors during model specification.},

  abstract = {We introduce Catalyst.jl, a flexible and feature-filled Julia library for modeling and high-performance simulation of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Catalyst supports simulating stochastic chemical kinetics (jump process), chemical Langevin equation (stochastic differential equation), and reaction rate equation (ordinary differential equation) representations for CRNs. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that Catalyst simulation runtimes are often one to two orders of magnitude faster than other popular tools. More broadly, Catalyst acts as both a domain-specific language and an intermediate representation for symbolically encoding CRN models as Julia-native objects. This enables a pipeline of symbolically specifying, analyzing, and modifying CRNs; converting Catalyst models to symbolic representations of concrete mathematical models; and generating compiled code for numerical solvers. Leveraging ModelingToolkit.jl and Symbolics.jl, Catalyst models can be analyzed, simplified, and compiled into optimized representations for use in numerical solvers. Finally, we demonstrate Catalyst's broad extensibility and composability by highlighting how it can compose with a variety of Julia libraries, and how existing open-source biological modeling projects have extended its intermediate representation.},

Multiple simultaneous efforts to                 create graphical standards, rule-based languages, and integrated software                 workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for                 transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an                 approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs.                 PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the                 rule-based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical                 tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions                 such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a                 high-level, action-oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python                 programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open-source software                 community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of                 testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously                 published models of apoptosis.},

Here, we describe a novel programmatic modeling paradigm, whereby modeling is augmented with software engineering best practices.

Models can be encoded as programs, adding benefits such as modularity, testing, and automated documentation generators, while still being extensible and exportable to standardized formats for use with external tools if desired.

To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models)~guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},

This paper introduces a high-level, modular extension of Kappa called LBS-{$\kappa$}. We demonstrate the constructs of the language through examples and three case studies: a chemotaxis switch ring, a MAPK cascade, and an insulin signalling pathway. We then provide a formal definition of LBS-{$\kappa$} through an abstract syntax and a translation to plain Kappa. The translation is implemented in a compiler tool which is available as a web application. We finally demonstrate how to increase the expressivity of LBS-{$\kappa$} through embedded scripts in a general-purpose programming language, a technique which we view as generally applicable to other domain specific languages.},

CRNs provide a principled modeling environment capable of expressing a huge range of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a software toolbox, written in Python, that compiles high-level design specifications represented using a modular library of biochemical parts, mechanisms, and contexts to CRN implementations. This compilation process offers four advantages. First, the building of the actual CRN representation is automatic and outputs Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models compatible with numerous simulators. Second, a library of modular biochemical components allows for different architectures and implementations of biochemical circuits to be represented succinctly with design choices propagated throughout the underlying CRN automatically. This prevents the often occurring mismatch between high-level designs and model dynamics. Third, high-level design specification can be embedded into diverse biomolecular environments, such as cell-free extracts and in vivo milieus. Finally, our software toolbox has a parameter database, which allows users to rapidly prototype large models using very few parameters which can be customized later. By using BioCRNpyler, users ranging from expert modelers to novice script-writers can easily build, manage, and explore sophisticated biochemical models using diverse biochemical implementations, environments, and modeling assumptions.},

Currently, many models are not easily reusable due to inflexible or confusing code, inappropriate languages, or insufficient documentation. Best practice suggestions rarely cover such low-level design aspects. This gap could be filled by software engineering, which addresses those same issues for software reuse. We show that languages can facilitate reusability by being modular, human-readable, hybrid (i.e., supporting multiple formalisms), open, declarative, and by supporting the graphical representation of models. Modelers should not only use such a language, but be aware of the features that make it desirable and know how to apply them effectively. For this reason, we compare existing suitable languages in detail and demonstrate their benefits for a modular model of the human cardiac conduction system written in Modelica.},

To help investigators find and use simulation tools, we developed BioSimulators (https://biosimulators.org), a central registry of the capabilities of simulation tools and consistent Python, command-line~and containerized interfaces to each version of each tool. The foundation of BioSimulators is standards, such as CellML, SBML, SED-ML~and the COMBINE archive format, and validation tools for simulation projects and simulation tools that ensure these standards are used consistently. To help modelers find tools for particular projects, we have also used the registry to develop recommendation services.

  abstract = {Mathematical models of biochemical networks can largely facilitate the comprehension of the mechanisms at the basis of cellular processes, as well as the formulation of hypotheses that can be tested by means of targeted laboratory experiments. However, two issues might hamper the achievement of fruitful outcomes. On the one hand, detailed mechanistic models can involve hundreds or thousands of molecular species and their intermediate complexes, as well as hundreds or thousands of chemical reactions, a situation generally occurring in rule-based modeling. On the other hand, the computational analysis of a model typically requires the execution of a large number of simulations for its calibration, or to test the effect of perturbations. As a consequence, the computational capabilities of modern Central Processing Units can be easily overtaken, possibly making the modeling of biochemical networks a worthless or ineffective effort. To the aim of overcoming the limitations of the current state-of-the-art simulation approaches, we present in this paper FiCoS, a novel "black-box" deterministic simulator that effectively realizes both a fine-grained and a coarse-grained parallelization on Graphics Processing Units. In particular, FiCoS exploits two different integration methods, namely, the Dormand-Prince and the Radau IIA, to efficiently solve both non-stiff and stiff systems of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations. We tested the performance of FiCoS against different deterministic simulators, by considering models of increasing size and by running analyses with increasing computational demands. FiCoS was able to dramatically speedup the computations up to 855{\texttimes}, showing to be a promising solution for the simulation and analysis of large-scale models of complex biological processes.},

  abstract = {BackgroundMathematical modeling and in silico analysis are widely acknowledged as complementary tools to biological laboratory methods, to achieve a thorough understanding of emergent behaviors of cellular processes in both physiological and perturbed conditions. Though, the simulation of large-scale models-consisting in hundreds or thousands of reactions and molecular species-can rapidly overtake the capabilities of Central Processing Units (CPUs). The purpose of this work is to exploit alternative high-performance computing solutions, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), to allow the investigation of these models at reduced computational costs.ResultsLASSIE is a "black-box" GPU-accelerated deterministic simulator, specifically designed for large-scale models and not requiring any expertise in mathematical modeling, simulation algorithms or GPU programming. Given a reaction-based model of a cellular process, LASSIE automatically generates the corresponding system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), assuming mass-action kinetics. The numerical solution of the ODEs is obtained by automatically switching between the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method in the absence of stiffness, and the Backward Differentiation Formulae of first order in presence of stiffness. The computational performance of LASSIE are assessed using a set of randomly generated synthetic reaction-based models of increasing size, ranging from 64 to 8192 reactions and species, and compared to a CPU-implementation of the LSODA numerical integration algorithm.ConclusionsLASSIE adopts a novel fine-grained parallelization strategy to distribute on the GPU cores all the calculations required to solve the system of ODEs. By virtue of this implementation, LASSIE achieves up to 92{\texttimes} speed-up with respect to LSODA, therefore reducing the running time from approximately 1 month down to 8 h to simulate models consisting in, for instance, four thousands of reactions and species. Notably, thanks to its smaller memory footprint, LASSIE is able to perform fast simulations of even larger models, whereby the tested CPU-implementation of LSODA failed to reach termination. LASSIE is therefore expected to make an important breakthrough in Systems Biology applications, for the execution of faster and in-depth computational analyses of large-scale models of complex biological systems.},

  abstract = {MotivationThis article presents libRoadRunner 2.0, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using the systems biology markup language (SBML).ResultslibRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run either as a component inside other tools via its C++, C and Python APIs, or interactively through its Python or Julia interface. libRoadRunner uses a custom just-in-time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a large variety of processors, making it fast enough to simulate extremely large models or repeated runs in reasonable timeframes. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) as well as several SBML extensions such as hierarchical composition and probability distributions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state, sensitivity, stability and structural analyses.Availability and implementationlibRoadRunner binary distributions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux, Julia and Python bindings, source code and documentation are all available at https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner, and Python bindings are also available via pip. The source code can be compiled for the supported systems as well as in principle any system supported by LLVM-13, such as ARM-based computers like the Raspberry Pi.
